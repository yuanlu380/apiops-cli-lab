# Setup GitHub Actions Identity for APIOps

> **How to use:** Open this file in VS Code with GitHub Copilot and ask
> Copilot to help you run through the steps. Copilot will prompt you for
> the required values and generate the exact CLI commands for your environment.

> **Important identity distinction:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` handles pull request creation automatically. The Azure app registration/service principal in this flow is only for Azure and APIM access.

## Agent Behavior

- **One step at a time.** Complete each step fully before moving to the next.
- **Confirm information.** After gathering user input, summarize what was provided and ask the user to confirm it is correct before proceeding.
- **Ask before proceeding.** At the end of each step, ask: "Step N is complete. Ready to proceed to Step N+1?"
- **Never combine steps.** Do not run commands from multiple steps together, even if they could be batched.
- **Stop on errors.** If any command fails, show the full error output and wait for the user to decide how to proceed.

## Goal

Configure Azure AD federated credentials and GitHub repository secrets so the
APIOps extract and publish workflows can authenticate to Azure using OIDC
(no stored client secrets needed).

---

## Step 0 — Tool Authentication Check

**Copilot: Before proceeding, verify that all required tools are installed and authenticated.**

Run these checks and present results in a table:

### Check Azure CLI
```bash
az version
az account show --query "{Subscription:name, Account:user.name, TenantId:tenantId}" -o json
```

### Check GitHub CLI
```bash
gh auth status
```

### Present Status Table

Present the results to the user in this format:

```
🔐 Tool Authentication Status:

| Tool | Status | Account/User | Subscription/Org | Tenant/Details |
|------|--------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Azure CLI | ✅ Logged in | user@example.com | my-subscription | abc-123-... |
| GitHub CLI | ✅ Logged in | username | github.com | — |
```

**Status indicators:**
- ✅ Logged in — tool is authenticated and ready
- ❌ Not logged in — tool needs authentication
- ⚠️ Not installed — tool is missing entirely

### Fix Missing Authentication

**If Azure CLI is not logged in:**
> "Azure CLI is required for this setup. Run `az login` to authenticate, then I'll continue."

**If GitHub CLI is not logged in:**
> "GitHub CLI is required for configuring repository secrets. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate."

**If any required tool is not installed:**
- Azure CLI: Install from https://aka.ms/installazurecli
- GitHub CLI: Install from https://cli.github.com

Once both tools are authenticated, ask the user to confirm:
> "Does this authentication look correct? (yes / need to switch accounts)"

If the user needs to switch accounts, help them with:
- Azure CLI: `az account set --subscription <id>` or `az login --tenant <tenant-id>`
- GitHub CLI: `gh auth logout` then `gh auth login`

Once confirmed, proceed to Step 1.

---

## Step 1 — Gather Information

Copilot, please ask the user for the following values before proceeding. Store
each answer for use in later steps.

**Ask for one value per question:**
- Ask for each variable in its own separate question. Never combine two or more variables into a single question, and never ask the user to fill in a `NAME=` template.
- In each question, state what the value is for (for example, "Resource group of the **prod** APIM instance") and show the example value.
- Accept the plain value as the answer (for example, `rg-apim-prod`, not `APIM_RG_PROD=rg-apim-prod`).
- If you can detect a likely value (for example, from `az account show` or `gh repo view`), offer it as the suggested answer to that single question so the user can accept or change it.

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_DEV` | Azure subscription ID for **dev** environment | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID (same for all environments) | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `GITHUB_ORG` | GitHub organization or user that owns the repo | `my-org` |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | GitHub repository name | `apim-artifacts` |
| `APP_NAME` | Display name for the Azure AD application | `apiops-github-sp` |
| `APIM_RG_DEV` | Resource group for **dev** APIM instance | `rg-apim-dev` |
| `APIM_NAME_DEV` | APIM service name for **dev** | `apim-dev` |

**Copilot:** After collecting all values, present a summary table and ask: "Please confirm these values are correct before I proceed."

---

## Step 2 — Create Azure AD Application & Service Principal

> ⚠️ **Error Handling:** If any command fails, stop immediately and show the user the full error output verbatim. Do NOT retry silently. Common issues include insufficient permissions (requires Application Administrator or Global Administrator role in Azure AD).

**On macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
# Create the Azure AD application
APP_ID=$(az ad app create \
  --display-name "${APP_NAME}" \
  --query appId -o tsv)

# Create the service principal for the application
az ad sp create --id "$APP_ID"

echo "Application (client) ID: $APP_ID"
echo "Tenant ID: $(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)"
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Create the Azure AD application
$APP_ID = az ad app create `
  --display-name "${APP_NAME}" `
  --query appId -o tsv

# Create the service principal for the application
az ad sp create --id $APP_ID

Write-Host "Application (client) ID: $APP_ID"
Write-Host "Tenant ID: $(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)"
```

---

## Step 3 — Assign RBAC Roles

Grant the service principal the required permissions:
1. **Reader** role on each resource group (to read resource groups and resources)
2. **API Management Service Contributor** on each APIM instance (to manage APIM resources)

> **Note:** Each environment can be in a different Azure subscription. The service principal will be granted access to all environments.

### Grant Reader role on each resource group

```bash
# Reader role for dev resource group
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$APP_ID" \
  --role "Reader" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_DEV}/resourceGroups/${APIM_RG_DEV}"
```

### Grant API Management Service Contributor on each APIM instance

```bash
# Assign role for dev environment
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$APP_ID" \
  --role "API Management Service Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_DEV}/resourceGroups/${APIM_RG_DEV}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/${APIM_NAME_DEV}"
```

---

## Step 4 — Create Federated Credentials for GitHub OIDC

> ⚠️ **Platform Note:** The JSON parameters for federated credentials require different escaping on Windows PowerShell vs macOS/Linux Bash. Use the appropriate command block for your platform.

### Main branch (for push-triggered publish workflow)

**On macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
az ad app federated-credential create \
  --id "$APP_ID" \
  --parameters '{
    "name": "github-main-branch",
    "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
    "subject": "repo:'"${GITHUB_ORG}"'/'"${GITHUB_REPO}"':ref:refs/heads/main",
    "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
  }'
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
az ad app federated-credential create `
  --id $APP_ID `
  --parameters '{\"name\":\"github-main-branch\",\"issuer\":\"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\",\"subject\":\"repo:'${GITHUB_ORG}'/'${GITHUB_REPO}':ref:refs/heads/main\",\"audiences\":[\"api://AzureADTokenExchange\"]}'
```

### dev environment

**On macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
az ad app federated-credential create \
  --id "$APP_ID" \
  --parameters '{
    "name": "github-env-dev",
    "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
    "subject": "repo:'"${GITHUB_ORG}"'/'"${GITHUB_REPO}"':environment:dev",
    "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
  }'
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
az ad app federated-credential create `
  --id $APP_ID `
  --parameters '{\"name\":\"github-env-dev\",\"issuer\":\"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\",\"subject\":\"repo:'${GITHUB_ORG}'/'${GITHUB_REPO}':environment:dev\",\"audiences\":[\"api://AzureADTokenExchange\"]}'
```


---

## Step 5 — Create GitHub Environments

```bash
# Create the dev environment (requires GitHub CLI)
gh api --method PUT "repos/${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}/environments/dev"
```

---

## Step 6 — Set GitHub Repository Secrets

> ⚠️ **Platform Note:** GitHub CLI secret commands work identically on all platforms, but variable syntax differs between Bash and PowerShell.

### Check for existing secrets before writing

**Never overwrite an existing secret silently.** First list repository and environment secret names (GitHub does not expose their values):

```bash
gh secret list --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}" --json name
gh secret list --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}" --env "dev" --json name
```

Compare the returned names with every secret this setup intends to create. For each conflict, ask the user to choose one option before running any `gh secret set` command:

1. **Overwrite** — replace the existing secret with the new value.
2. **Rename** — ask for or confirm an alternative name, such as `APIOPS_AZURE_CLIENT_ID`. Accept only GitHub secret names containing letters, numbers, and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore, and not starting with `GITHUB_`. For each scope, maintain a case-insensitive reserved-name set initialized from its inventory. Check the alternative against that set and add each chosen name immediately; if it is already reserved, resolve that conflict before writing.
3. **Reuse** — keep the existing secret and skip its `gh secret set` command.

Do not infer that an existing secret has the intended value because GitHub cannot return secret values. Reuse is an explicit user decision.

Keep a scope-aware mapping with the repository, scope (`repository` or `environment`), environment name when applicable, expected name, chosen name, and action. The same expected name may map differently in different environments.

If any secret is renamed, inspect generated workflow files under `.github/workflows/` and update references for that exact scope. Handle both literal expressions such as `secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and computed expressions such as `secrets[format('APIM_RESOURCE_GROUP_{0}', ...)]`. When an expected name maps differently by environment, replace the shared computed lookup with an environment-keyed expression that covers every environment mapping; retain the original computed lookup as the fallback for unchanged environments. Apply the same rule to environment-scoped `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` renames. Show the complete mapping and proposed file changes, then obtain confirmation before editing. Do not replace unrelated text or secret names.

After all conflicts are resolved, run only the `gh secret set` commands approved by the user, using the mapped names where applicable.

**On macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
# Repository-level secrets (shared across all workflows)
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID --body "$APP_ID" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID --body "${AZURE_TENANT_ID}" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"

# dev environment secrets
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --body "${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_DEV}" --env "dev" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"
gh secret set APIM_RESOURCE_GROUP_DEV --body "${APIM_RG_DEV}" --env "dev" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"
gh secret set APIM_SERVICE_NAME_DEV --body "${APIM_NAME_DEV}" --env "dev" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"

```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Repository-level secrets (shared across all workflows)
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID --body $APP_ID --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID --body "${AZURE_TENANT_ID}" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"

# dev environment secrets
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --body "${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_DEV}" --env "dev" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"
gh secret set APIM_RESOURCE_GROUP_DEV --body "${APIM_RG_DEV}" --env "dev" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"
gh secret set APIM_SERVICE_NAME_DEV --body "${APIM_NAME_DEV}" --env "dev" --repo "${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}"

```

Summarize each secret as **created**, **overwritten**, **renamed**, or **reused**, and list any workflow files updated for renamed secrets. Never print secret values in the summary.

---

## Step 7 — Verify

> ⚠️ **Important:** If any verification step fails, show the user the full error output and help troubleshoot before proceeding. Common issues include RBAC permissions not yet propagated (can take 5-10 minutes) or missing secrets.

1. Go to **Actions** → **Run APIM Extractor** → **Run workflow**
2. Fill in the resource group and service name for your dev environment
3. Confirm the workflow completes and a pull request is created

If the workflow fails with authentication errors:
- Check that all secrets are set correctly in GitHub: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Verify RBAC role assignments have propagated (wait 5-10 minutes and retry)
- Confirm the federated credentials were created: `az ad app federated-credential list --id $APP_ID`

---

## Secrets Reference

The generated workflows expect these secrets:

### Repository Secrets
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` — App registration client ID (shared across all environments)
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` — Azure AD tenant ID (shared across all environments)

### Per-Environment Secrets
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` — Azure subscription ID for **dev** environment
- `APIM_RESOURCE_GROUP_DEV` — Resource group containing the **dev** APIM instance
- `APIM_SERVICE_NAME_DEV` — APIM service name for **dev**
